* Learned how to create a circuit that holds memory through D-latches, demultiplexers, and multiplexers.
* Learned how to use the always function to ensure a value updates when it is supposed to.

## Lab Questions

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
* Because it will result to an error when synthesizing because of a combinatorial loop.

### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
* 

### What importance is memory to digital circuits?
